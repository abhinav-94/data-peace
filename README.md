server.js needs to be initialized and it will be connected to the database as well. I have used sandbox account on mlabs
once the server is up and running you can use Postman to meke the calls to the route end points
all the routes have been defined as asked
in the get route, please put empty space whichever parameter you are not passing,
For eg,. if you are not passing name then put [name=]
in the key value pair in Postman.

Rest of the routes can be used directly
